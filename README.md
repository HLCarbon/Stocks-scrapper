# Stocks-scrapper
Stock scapper to help me choose stocks to invest in

### Welcome to my stock scapper

This program is separated into two parts:
- The fisrt file [Stock_downloader](https://github.com/HLCarbon/Stocks-scrapper/blob/main/Stock_downloader.ipynb) goes to the website [roic.ai](roic.ai) and downloads 
the information the all the stocks and saves it in the csv folder. **Note:** Downloading all the stocks takes a loooooooooooong time.
- The second file [Evaluate_stocks](https://github.com/HLCarbon/Stocks-scrapper/blob/main/Evaluate_stocks.ipynb) analyzes the stocks present in the csv folder and analyzes it using some metrics. These metrics are based on the eight pillars used by the youtube channel [Everythig Money](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverythingMoney) (with some slight modificatoins). Then, just like investor Joel Greenblatt in his book **The Little Book That Beats the Market**, for each category, it sorts each stock and gives it the ranking number. For each stock it then sums the ranking of each category and sorts the stocks by that sum. The lower the final number, the better.

### Hope you enjoy!
